% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (DAC, single ended output at “0.1V” setting via BNC or XLR-to-RCA adapter)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer to RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.

% General information:
name = RTX6001 0.1-V SINGLE ENDED OUTPUT
type = DAC
sensitivity = 0.070711 V % 100% full scale input to DAC gives 0.070711 V at BNC output

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
