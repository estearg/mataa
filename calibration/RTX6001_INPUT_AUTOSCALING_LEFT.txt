% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (ADC, input range detected automatically via USB)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer to RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.

% General information:
name = RTX6001 AUTOSCALING INPUT (LEFT CHANNEL)
type = ADC
sensitivity_autoscalefunction = RTX6001_AUTOSCALINGFUNCTION_ADC('LEFT')

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
