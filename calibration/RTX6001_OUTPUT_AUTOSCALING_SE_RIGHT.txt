% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (DAC, BNC/single-ended output range detected automatically via USB)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer to RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.

% General information:
name = RTX6001 AUTOSCALING SINGLE-ENDED OUTPUT (RIGHT CHANNEL)
type = DAC
sensitivity_autoscalefunction = RTX6001_AUTOSCALINGFUNCTION_DAC_SE('RIGHT')

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
