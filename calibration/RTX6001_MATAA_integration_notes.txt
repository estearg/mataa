*** Autoscaling using the RTX6001 audio analyser with MATAA ***

Steps to make RTX6001 autoscaling work with MATAA:

1. Linux (Ubuntu): Make a UDEV rule to allow non-root access to the RTX6001 via USB
file: /etc/udev/rules.d/90-RTX6001-hidraw-permissions.rules
content: ATTRS{idVendor}=="0d9a" , ATTRS{idProduct}=="00df" , MODE="0666"

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x available on your computer, and the python-hid module is installed.
(Ubuntu and similar Linux distros: sudo apt install python3-hid)

3. Make sure the RTX6001_USB_STATUS file in the .../mataa/calibration folder is marked as executable.
Run the RTX6001_USB_STATUS program to see if it works.

4. Make sure the .../mataa/calibration folder in in your Octave / Matlab search path

5. Configure your calibration file to suit your setup. You can use the MB_RTX_AUTOSCALING_LEFT.txt cal file as a template.

6. Use the mataa_cal_autoscaling function with your cal file (or just use the MB_RTX_AUTOSCALING_LEFT.txt file to test things).
