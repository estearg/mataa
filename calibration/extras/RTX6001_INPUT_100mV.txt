% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (ADC, input at “100mV” setting)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.
% General information:name = RTX6001 100-mV INPUT
type = ADCsensitivity = 7.0711 1/V % 0.1414 Volt at input gives 100% full scale at ADC output
% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
