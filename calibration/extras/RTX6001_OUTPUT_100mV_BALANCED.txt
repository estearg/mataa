% Calibration file for RTX6001 audio analyser (DAC, XLR/balanced output at “100 mV” setting)
%
% NOTE: the voltage labels on the RTX6001 front panel refer to RMS values of a sine signal. Multiply the front panel labels by sqrt(2) to obtain the peak voltage.
%

% General information:
name = RTX6001 100-mV BALANCED OUTPUT
type = DAC
sensitivity = 0.14142 V % 100% full scale input to DAC gives 0.14142 V at XLR output (measured from POS to NEG pins)

% Frequency response is very flat, so no transfer function data is included here.
