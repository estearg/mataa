% function [s,t] = mataa_realIFT0 (S,f);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Calculates the inverse Fourier transform of a spectrum S(f) of a signal with real-valued samples. Only the 'positive' half of the spectrum is used, i.e. only positive frequencies (including f=0) must be given as input. See also mataa_realFT0.
%
% INPUT:
% S: complex fourier spectrum of the signal ('positive' half, see also DESCRIPTION).
% f: frequency values (vector)
%
% OUTPUT:
% s: signal samples (real-valued samples)
% t: time values of the signal
