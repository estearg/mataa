%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Extend frequency response (e.g. from an anechoic analysis of a loudspeaker impulse response measured in the far field) with low-frequency data (e.g. from a near-field measurement). The frequency ranges of the two frequency responses need to overlap, and the common data in the frequency range [f1,f2] is used to determine the offsets in the magnitude and phase of the two frequency-response data sets. The low-frequency magnitude and phase (ml, pl) is adjusted to fit the high-frequency data (mh, ph). The phase data (ph, pl) may either be wrapped (e.g. to a range of -180..+180 deg) or unwrapped. After adjusting the relative offsets, the resulting response in the overlap band is computed as the weighted mean of the low and high frequency data, where the weight of the high-frequency data increases linearly from 0 at f1 to 1 at f2 (and vice versa for the low-frequency data).
%
% INPUT:
% mh, ph, fh: magnitude (dB), phase (deg.) and frequency (Hz) data of the frequency response covering the high-frequency range
% ml, pl, fl: magnitude (dB), phase (deg.) and frequency (Hz) data of the frequency response covering the low-frequency range
% f1, f2: [f1,f2] is the frequency range used to determine the offsets of the low-frequency magnitude and phase (ml, pl) relative to the high-frequency data (mh, ph).
%
% OUTPUT:
% mag, phase, f: magnitude (dB), phase (deg, unwrapped) and frequency (Hz) of the combined frequency response. The data with f > f2 are identical to (mh,ph,fh), those with f < f1 correspond to (ml,pl,fl) with the magnitude and phase offsets removed. The data in the range [f1,f2] corresponds to the combination of the data of both data sets.
