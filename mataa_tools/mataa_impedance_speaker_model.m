% function [mag,phase] = mataa_impedance_speaker_model (f,Rdc,f0,Qe,Qm,L1,L2,R2)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Calculate speaker impedance (magnitude and phase) as a function of frequency f according to the MLSSA model (see Figure 7.16 in J. d'Appolito, "Testing Loudspeakers", Audio Amateur Press). This model essentially consists of a combination of three impedance elements connected in series (where w = 2*pi*f, w0 = 2*pi*f0):
% (a) The DC resistance of the voice coil (Rdc)
% (b) A parallel LCR circuit, reflecting the the low-frequency part of the impedance curve (resonance peak).
% (c) L1 in series with a parallel combination of R2 and L2. L1, L2, and R2 reflect the high-frequency part of the impedance curve. For L2 = 0 and R2 = Inf, this model reduces to the simpler concept where the voice-coil inductance Le is constant with frequency (and L1 = Le).
%
% INPUT:
% f: frequency values for which impedance will be calculatedq
% Rdc: DC resistance of the voice coil (Ohm)
% f0: resonance frequency of the speaker (Hz)
% Qe: electrical quality factor of the speaker (at resonance)
% Qm: mechanical quality factor of the speaker (at resonance)
% L1, L2, R2 (optional): see above (in H or Ohm, respectively)
%
% OUTPUT:
% mag: magnitude of impedance (Ohm)
% phase: phase of impedance (degrees)
%
% NOTES:
%    - The ratio Qm/Qe reflects the height of the impedance peak. If Zmax is the impedance maximum (at resonance) then Zmax/Rdc = Qm/Qe+1.
%    - Qe reflects the width of the impedance peak (large Qe corresponds to a narrow peak)
%
% EXAMPLE:
% The following gives a good approximation of the data shown in Fig. 7.18 in J. d'Appolito, "Testing oudspeaker" on page 122:
% f = logspace(1,4,100);
% [mag,phase] = mataa_impedance_speaker_model (f,7.66,33.22,0.45,3.4,0.4e-3,1.1e-3,13);
% semilogx (f,mag,f,phase)
