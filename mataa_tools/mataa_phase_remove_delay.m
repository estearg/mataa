function phase = mataa_phase_remove_delay (phase,f,delay);

% function [phase,f] = mataa_phase_remove_delay (phase,f,delay);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function removes excess phase due to time delay.
%
% INPUT:
% phase: phase, including excess phase due to time delay (unwrapped, in degrees)
% f: frequency coordinates of phase (in Hz)
% delay: time delay to be removed from the phase (in seconds)
%
% OUTPUT:
% phase: phase with excess phase corresponding to delay removed (unwrapped, in degrees)
